## 1. Grading

-   Labs are due as indicated on URCourses.
-   Lab grading is out of 100 points.
-   This lab is integrated into GitHub Classroom and all assignments
    will be submitted through GitHub. Students are required to sign up
    for GitHub.
-   Late labs are accepted at a deduction rate of 10% per day.
-   Ensure that you have access to the lab via your entry card. If it is
    not working, please see the office staff to program your card for
    that door.
-   If you need to see me outside the lab, please email me to set up a
    time. (You can of course try to come by my office, but I may not
    always be there.)


## 2. AI and LLM Use Policy

Students are permitted to use AI tools (such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot,
etc.) as assistants, not as substitutes for their own work. The
following rules apply:

### 2.1 Documentation Requirements

Any use of AI tools must be clearly documented in your submission.
Include:

-   What tool was used.
-   What it was used for (e.g., code generation, debugging advice,
    documentation).
-   Which parts of the code or writing were influenced or generated by
    AI

### 2.2 Other Key Policies

-   **Understand What You Submit:** You must be able to explain and
    defend every line of code or content you submit, regardless of how
    it was produced. During code reviews or oral checks, inability to do
    so may result in academic penalties.
-   **No Use on Individual Exams or Tests:** AI use is strictly
    prohibited during any individual assessments unless explicitly
    allowed.
-   **Originality & Plagiarism:** Directly copying code or content from
    any source --- AI or otherwise --- without modification or
    understanding is considered plagiarism. AI-generated code must still
    reflect your own logic and decision-making.
-   **Learning First:** These tools are helpful, but the goal is to
    learn. If AI is doing the thinking for you, you're missing the
    point. Use it to enhance your learning, not to avoid it.


## 3. Safety

-   Please let the lab instructor know if you see any frayed electrical
    cords.
-   University Fire & Evacuation Procedure is on URCourses.
-   Any students who might need assistance during a building evacuation,
    please let me know.
-   In case of the alarm, all students must evacuate and not return
    until directed to do so by the Fire Wardens.

## 4. Plagiarism

Copying software is not tolerated. A tool is used to check for code
similarity. Collaboration is encouraged, but please discuss solutions
using pseudocode and diagrams. Do not cut and paste code. Always give
credit for code that you use from other sources.


## 5. Software Marking Scheme

This software marking scheme is adapted from colleague Karim Naqvi. Your
program or project will be built and tested on the appropriate target or
platform. The code will also be visually inspected.

### Grading Breakdown (Out of 100)

-   **80--100%**: All (or almost all) of the assignment solved and
    documented, and packaged in a professional manner.
-   **70--79%**: Most of the assignment solved, but at least one key
    issue missing, or significant issues with documentation or
    packaging.
-   **60--69%**: Some of the assignment solved, with at least half of
    the key issues resolved, but at least two key issues missing.
-   **50--59%**: A solution has been attempted, with at least one but
    less than half of the key issues resolved.
-   **0--49%**: No solution has been attempted, or the attempted
    solution did not resolve any of the key issues of the assignment.
