# Docker 

## 🐳 What is Docker?
Docker is a tool that lets you run software in a clean, isolated environment called a **container**.

A container includes:
- The operating system tools it needs  
- All required programming languages  
- All necessary libraries  
- Your code  

Because everything is packaged together, containers run **exactly the same on every computer**.

---

## 📦 Why Containers Are Useful
- **Reproducible setup** — everyone gets the same environment  
- **Isolated** — doesn’t interfere with your system  
- **Fast** — much lighter than virtual machines  
- **Portable** — works on Windows, Mac, and Linux without changes

## 🏗️ How Docker Works (Simple)
### **Images**
A Docker *image* is like a blueprint.  
It defines everything inside the environment (e.g., Ubuntu, Java, Flutter, Node.js).

### **Containers**
A container is a *running instance* of an image.  
Think of an image as a class and a container as an object.

## 🧪 Example
Without Docker:
- Students install different Java versions  
- SDKs are missing  
- Dependencies break  
- Nothing matches  

With Docker:
- Instructor provides **one image**  
- Everyone uses it  
- Everything works the same  

---

## 🚀 In Short
**Docker = A standardized, isolated, portable coding environment.**  
It removes setup problems and ensures consistent results.
